64miniword is a 40 column word processor for the Commodore 64 with features that were cutting-edge for the day, such as word-wrap, unword-wrap, line insert/delete, line centering, screen color control, tabbing (indent), wysiwyg printing on a supported printer, disk control, file saving/loading, search, go to line, and even a built-in calculator.  

"mw-switcheroo" a separate program for converting to/from miniword format and a standard cbm petscii file.

Full documentation for the program are in the text file "mw_docs.txt".  They can also be read using 64miniword itself (it includes a little tutorial).  This file is called "2.5docs.mw" or "2.5docs.mw.prg" in the source directory.  

Building:
64miniword and switcheroo are built using the BLITZ! compiler, but can be tested (slowly) in BASIC.

The assembly portion was originally written for the LADS, but obviously has been ported to 64 prg studio format.  

The assembly file **MUST** be renamed to "v2.5 ml" before using with either of the two BASIC tools.
